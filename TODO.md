# TODO

- all 5 cards must be rendered in the table in two columns, that way the first
  column displays 4 cards and the second column displays the last card. this
  will allow for a more dynamic layout instead of weird fixed layouts and
  margins
- keep the "info" button always visible. near the "table" of the game
- highlight the "info" button on first visit
- use the following colors as `dark` variant of cards:
  - background: `#060b09`
  - hearts and diamonds: `#f50808`
  - spades and clubs: `#dddbd8`
- remove custom styles for the scrollbar
- show a progress bar to indicate how many points the player is near to win
